This framework is made  using Fluent page object model and Page Component model.
I have used Extent Reports with Auto Report for the reporting which takes screenshots where ever test case gets failed, And have implemented the logging of each test step to be able to understand how the test flowed in the ExtentReport.
This Framework is built to handle parallel testing and can be executed by connecting it with CI/CD tools like Jenkins
